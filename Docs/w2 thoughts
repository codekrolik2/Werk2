A flow is a console app
A flow is a REST method

++ 20) executors default sync


1) visual graph output in md with mermaid
6) flow id is a field? Probably not becuase Id is needed to express parent-child relationship
7) parallelism on different machines with and without persistence
11) autowrap in step and flow for calls??
16) listeners can run flows but nested listeners will be ignored
19) asynchronous execution (callbacks) + manual child flow spawn and control

--------------------------------------------------------------------

10.1) in a batch of functions all should return success unless configured otherwise. ??

Listener definitions on Flow/Step level - can they or can't they refer to Executor fields (RO input)?
	- special constants like execution time?
Listener definitions on Executor level - can they or can't they refer to Flow/Step fields (RO input)?

The answer in preliminary doc is that they can, but this needs to be thought through

Maybe use prefixes:
E:engineName - Engine field
F:actionId - Flow field
S:userName - Step field
Now, come to think of it, Executor/Transitioner/Listener have no fields.
Speculation about fields should be accepted with warning - runtime error is possible.

The following is possible to do with engine-level injection, but also with special parameter types:
	*) For persistence Flow serialization should be available to listeners (SERIALIZER)
	*) For running network requests on Vertx some engine context should be available to listeners (ENGINE_CONTEXT)

18) special parameters - step,flow,executor - (??? is a function name???)

8) call any function as a flow and any flow as a function

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Step can put exec/transit/step/flow or raw functions in exec or transit, if listeners/overides don't matter or are defined at step level.
- if step function used as an executor will try to transit to a different step, that would be end of execution and transition status will be dropped.
- if step function used as a transitioner will try to transit, that will be considered as transitioner trying to transit.

Flow can put steps or transits or raw transit function to define first step/steps.
